Linux:-

1.Linux Directory Structure:-
    1.Linux will keeps all the data in form of files in different locaitons.
    2.It contains a root directory ->sub-directories->Files.
Note:- Whenever you installed an operating system you will not see -Drive, Hard Disk. You will see only / or Mount Drive.

Directories:-
Note:- All the below directories are created under the / Mount Point.
1. /bin = Whatever the commands you have stored located in binary file.
Note:- Creating a user, file or a directory everything will be stored in /bin(Which contains all the files for your complete commands)
2. /boot 
Note:- In windows machines you can see reserved partitions into the systems.(u can see like windows7,8 and 10) = It contains booting files installed into it by default.
And also it contains lilo operations system and also grub and grub2
3. /dev = The directory contains all the device files
Note:- If you connected a Hard Disk or if you created partition into the hard disk everything will be stored in the devices.
Even if you connect with usb, cd-drive or dvd drive this will be stored again in devices.
4. /etc = Configuration files
Note:- If you configure any ip addresses or servers related it will store in /etc
5. /Home = It contains all directories of users
Note:- If i want to create an user that will save in the /home directory. If any user login to the user.
This is basically only for standard users(Which is non-root or non-super users)
6. /Lib = It contains all the library files
Note:- All the parameters of the command will see  in the library.
7. /media = You can find hot plug-in-play devices automounted over here.
Note:- It is easier to user to work on the desktop of any of the linux distributor
8. /mnt
9. /opt  = Add on applications
Note:- What ever the optmizes data is present is stored in /opt
10. /sbin = This super user can use this /sbin for storing its all the binary files and what are the commands is going to be use will be pulled by the Binary cell.
11. /srv = Service Data = 
12. /tmp = whatever the temporary files you have store in temp.
Note:- Once your files get delted your files get flushed out.
13. /usr = User Programs = Applications, Programs, tools
14. /var = It contains all the variable files 
Note:- Variable files or Varibale data are those things we generally change 
                1.If domain name changes or if ur ip address of your local host ip address changes it automatically replicate or changes into it.
     So, those data which generally vary which are not constant and that is stored in /var
15. /root = Basically it is a home directory of the home user. 
Note:- 1./home contains  standard user directory.
               2.But root stores complete data in the /root directory.
16. /proc = Process Information = Process and Progress rate of the RAM.
17. /lost+found = Misplaced Data = It is a directory which we have all the distributors(which is misplaced) 
Note:- Misplaced means:- Like which do not have a proper location where it should be stored by default it moves to lost+found.





Linux File Management:-
1.Ordinary Files:- Data, Text or Program Instructions
2.Special Files:- Files provide acces to hardware such as hard-drive, CD-ROM, modems and ethernet adapters 
3.Directories:- Store both ordinary and special files.
